# **Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes in patients using clinical data. It showcases an end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation, aimed at improving early diagnosis and healthcare outcomes.

## **Features**
- **Predictive Analytics**: Accurate prediction of diabetes risk based on health indicators.
- **Models Implemented**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and class imbalance using SMOTE.

## **Why This Project?**
Diabetes is a global health concern. Early prediction can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project integrates AI/ML to assist healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions.

## **Getting Started**
### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Run the Project**
- Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script and execute the cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## **Results**
- **Best Model**: Random Forest  
   - Accuracy: **78.35%**
   - AUC: **0.95**
   - Minimal false negatives ensure reliability.
- **Top Predictors**: Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure.
